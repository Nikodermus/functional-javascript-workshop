# Tarea

Modify the recursive `repeat` function provided in the boilerplate, such that it does not block the event loop (i.e. Timers and IO handlers can fire). This necessarily requires repeat to be asynchronous.

A timeout is queued to fire after 100 milliseconds, which will print the results of the test and exit the process. `repeat` should release control of the event loop to allow the timeout to interrupt before all of the operations complete.

Try to perform as many operations as you can before the timeout fires!

## Condiciones

- No uses ciclos `for/while` o `Array#forEach`.
- No crees ninguna funci√≥n innecesaria, e.j. funciones auxiliares.

## Pista

- If your program takes a long time to run, something is probably wrong.
  Use Control - C to kill the node process.

## Plantilla

```js
function repeat(operation, num) {
  // modify this so it can be interrupted
  if (num <= 0) return;
  operation();
  return repeat(operation, --num);
}

module.exports = repeat;
```
